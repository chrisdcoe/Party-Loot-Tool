# Party-Loot-Tool
A tool for handling party inventory in role-playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons

This project was written in JavaScript using Node.js Express and MongoDB.

NOTICE: This is currently a work in progress. Still need to have a delete button,
allow for usernames, and implement a total GP value.

Desired features for future:
Allow user to add party members and assign items to characters.
Track value of each individual's holdings to compare to fair party share
